What i have learned here is:

-That a variable is a container that stores a value & that it behaves as if it were the value it contains.
-learned to define number, string and boolean data types using 'let' keyword
-let age = 20;
-let name = "Boston";
-let isStudent = "true";
-learnt to show that the data type i chose to use using the typeof keyword
